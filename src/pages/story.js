        If someone told me a year ago that I would be coding and even building
        my own app now, my answer might very well be: when pigs can fly! I have
        a master’s degree in English language and literature, no CS background
        whatsoever. Considering myself more of a humanities person, I’ve never
        entertained the idea of pursuing a career in technology. But here I am
        somehow, and this is my story. From zero to first steps I was at a low
        point in my life a while ago: not really enjoying what I was doing and
        feeling clueless about my career. I decided I needed a change. I want to
        do something that can be both fun and productive. But what should I
        learn? I wasn’t feeling particularly passionate about anything then. My
        good friend Sean suggested I should try programming. It’s fun, cool and
        practical. Seeing how passionate he is building his own app, I decided
        to give it a go. I’m lucky to have Sean as my coding mentor throughout
        this journey. Sean recommended JavaScript to me as a first language. JS
        is beginner-friendly, relatively easily to learn, and the only (more or
        less) front end programming language. As an absolute beginner, I believe
        visualizing the stuff I’m building would greatly sustain my interest and
        motivation, especially at the early stage. Besides, I’ve always had an
        interest in design. If I were to become a developer, I’d imagine myself
        doing the kind of work that overlaps design and engineering. Hence JS
        seems to be a good fit for me. I started with FreeCodeCamp. At this
        time, I knew absolutely nothing about web development. To be fair
        though, I may have heard of “HTML” before. It turned out my first
        encounter was not as bad as I expected. My “Hello World” trial went
        quite smoothly. I got to know how CSS actually works. Just a bunch of
        tags and styling rules, I said to myself, nothing too tricky (how
        naïve!). I exceeded my own expectations by finishing the first part
        “responsive web design” rather quickly. Feeling confident, I started to
        work on the project assignments, and experienced my first moments of
        frustration. How do I center this? Why is this not where I want it to
        be? How to make this grid work... There just seemed to be endless
        problems. But am I a person who gives up so easily? So every day I
        motivated myself: What do we say to CSS? Not today… I finally finished
        my first web page project, which looks bearable… This did prompt me to
        consider better learning modes. Since it’s impossible to memorize all
        those rules, and solving a CSS problem can be really time-consuming and
        discouraging for beginners, perhaps I should learn something else and
        come back to these practices once in a while. I proceeded to JS. It’s a
        totally different mindset doing JS exercises, more function-oriented and
        logically coherent. That was when I started to grow into programming. So
        if you are experiencing the same frustrations about CSS, don’t overwork
        yourself on it. Try learning something new when feeling stuck, and when
        you come back to it with your spirits lifted, things may feel easier.
        Valley of despair It took me a while to get the basics out of the way. I
        feel rather conflicted about data structures and algorithms. On the one
        hand, solving math problems can be really fun and fulfilling; on the
        other hand, I felt completely beaten up when I racked my brains to come
        up with a solution and failed. I was never quite good at math in school,
        therefore I’m not confident with my logic thinking. I was constantly
        casted into self-doubt, thinking of giving up. At such moments, I would
        ask Sean for help. He’d show me how he approaches a problem step by
        step. With his guidance, I learned to develop a systematic
        problem-solving pattern: 1. Clarify the problem. Define the goal and the
        concepts that may be related. 2. Develop an action plan by writing down
        specific steps (pseudo code). 3. Code the lines step by step. 4. Test
        after each step and debug. I’ve been benefiting remarkably from this,
        both at the stage of learning and when I started to build productive
        projects. Through such systematic and deductive coding training, I
        gradually gained my confidence back and managed to push myself forward
        one bit at a time. Small successes: As I finished the JS basics, I
        proceeded to a more advanced part: using front end frameworks.
